Generative Ai project
The generative AI component of this project uses the google/flan-t5-base model, a fine-tuned version of Google's T5 model specifically trained to better follow human instructions. Unlike generic language models that may require large datasets for training, FLAN-T5 has been instruction-tuned on multiple datasets to excel at a wide variety of tasks with minimal task-specific training. This makes it highly effective for text-to-text generation tasks such as summarization, translation, and reasoning, even in zero-shot scenarios.
